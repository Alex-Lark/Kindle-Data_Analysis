I worked with a Kindle dataset of over 100,000 entries, focusing on cleaning, processing, and extracting insights from the data. Using techniques such as Linear Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models, I explored relationships within the dataset and predicted book ratings and performance based on features like category, author, and reviews.
